        My Calisthenics Journey
    </h1>
      <p>I've been doing calisthenics since November 2020. Was really unathletic and overweight before, hence the slow start.</p>

        Got carpal tunnel from wrist overuse lmao
        Taking a break from handstands/false grips, and probably will go to a clinic to get it checked out, even though theres no more pain now.
        Started watching a lot of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/Kbogea'>K Boges</a> on Youtube, so I'm trying high rep high frequency work
        which doubles as recovery.
        Currently working on a rotation of:
        5x35 pushups
        5x8 deep ring dips
        5x9 pause rep pullups
        20x5 pullups
        5x20 weighted (+20) pushups
        5x10 elevated pike pushups
