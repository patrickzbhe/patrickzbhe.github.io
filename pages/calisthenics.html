    <h1>My Calisthenics Journey</h1>
    <p>
      I've been doing calisthenics since November 2020. Was really unathletic
      and overweight before, hence the slow start.
    </p>

    <h3>November 2020</h3>
    <p>
      Can't do one pushup lol. <br />

    </p>
    <h3>January 2021</h3>
    <p>~20 pushups</p>
    <h3>March 2021</h3>
    <p>~45 pushups 1 minute</p>
    <h3>May 2021</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>Jan 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Got carpal tunnel from wrist overuse lmao <br />
      Taking a break from handstands/false grips, and probably will go to a
      clinic to get it checked out, even though theres no more pain now.
      <br />
      Started watching a lot of
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kbogea">K Boges</a> on Youtube, so
      I'm trying high rep high frequency work which doubles as recovery.<br />
      Currently working on a rotation of:<br />
      5x35 pushups <br />5x8 deep ring dips <br />5x9 pause rep pullups<br />20x5
      pullups <br />5x20 weighted (+20) pushups <br />5x10 elevated pike pushups
      <br />5x10s lsit hold
    </p>
    <h3>March 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Went to the gym for the first time in a while... so I got my first muscle up! :) <br/>
      Didn't wanna injure myself first time back so I went light on the weights: <br/>
      135 x 7 bench <br/>
      45 x 10 dips <br/>
      80 x 7 military press <br/>
      also got a clean tuck planche now, +10 degree (ish?) Lsit <br/>
      after countless pike pushups I think I can bent arm handstand but I don't wanna injure my wrists. Might try it soon. <br/>
      I hope by the time I come back to Waterloo from SF I can do a back lever <br/>

    </p>
    <h3>April 2022</h3>
    <p>
      L-sit to bent arm handstand!!!
    </p>
    <h3>May 2022</h3>
    <p>
      Moving + no more access to waterloo house means only ($40/month XD!) gym workouts rn rip. On the bright side, training legs now. <br/>
      We'll see when I get back into calisthenics
    </p>
