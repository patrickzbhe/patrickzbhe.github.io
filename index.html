        <p>
            I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying computer science. <br/> 
            I like programming, problem-solving, and have some other interests 
            listed on here.

        I have longer and perhaps more useful projects on my github, but these are my favourites.

        <p class='project-description'>
            WikiSolver is a human-like search engine for solving the Wikipedia game where you have to traverse from one Wikipedia page to another 
            through only clicking links. I built it so I could easily beat my friends in this game without using very obscure or odd paths like how
            a normal engine might try and solve it. Also, it doesn't require a database because of this as it tries to be efficient in its search path.

            Webb Generator
        </h1>
        <p class='project-description'>
            Webb Generator is a PIC Basic code generator written in Python. It produces Basic code that is able to be directly run on an LED cube that I made.
            The UI draws the cube in 3D so you can pick and choose how you want the cube to look, and you can rotate it to get an idea of what it might look like. 
            After clicking generate it produces code that draws a certain pattern on the LED cube for a certain amount of time.
